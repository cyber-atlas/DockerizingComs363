<p>This is an effort to help others who had technological issues in Com S 363 at Iowa State
This is my attempt to do so through the use of Docker.
A lot of the information contained in this guide is not my own. I used many
resources to help create this.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-">Prerequisites <br /></h2>
<p>An installation of Docker.
This can be done in multiple ways.</p>

<p>TODO finish this</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative-to-mysql-workbench-">An Alternative To Mysql Workbench <br /></h2>
<p>Mysql Workbench is the software installed by default on the VMs that we use in
the class. If you are having issues accessing the VMs, then it’s recommended
that you download it locally.</p>

<p>I personally found that Mysql Workbench is clunky and lacks a lot of the
features I enjoy in an IDE. I personally decided not to use it. I did not like
the idea of installing a software that I did not enjoy using. Instead I chose to
use DataGrip, the IDE for databases provided by JetBrains.</p>

<p>JetBrains creates IDEs for a wide variety of programming languages, many of which
have free Community Editions. Sadly they do not have a Community Edition of DataGrip.
However, as a student you’re eligible for an educational license, allowing you
to use all of their products for free. To get the educational license, press the
‘Apply Now’ button on the page. You sign up with your school email and are
approved in minutes. Then you are able to download all of their programs and all
you have to do is login when using them.</p>

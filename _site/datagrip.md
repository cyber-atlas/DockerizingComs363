## An Alternative To Mysql Workbench

Mysql Workbench is the software installed by default on the VMs that we use in the class. If you are having issues accessing the VMs, then it’s recommended that you download it locally.

### Why An Alternative?

I personally found that Mysql Workbench is clunky and lacks a lot of the features I enjoy in an IDE. I personally decided not to use it. I did not like the idea of installing a software that I did not enjoy using. Instead I chose to use DataGrip, the IDE for databases provided by JetBrains.

### Who Are They And How do I Get It?

JetBrains creates IDEs for a wide variety of programming languages, many of which have free Community Editions. Sadly they do not have a Community Edition of DataGrip. However, as a student you’re eligible for an educational license, allowing you to use all of their products for free. To get the educational license, press the ‘Apply Now’ button on the page. You sign up with your school email and are approved in minutes. Then you are able to download all of their programs and all you have to do is login when using them.

Once you have registered and gotten your educational license, you can download
the software.

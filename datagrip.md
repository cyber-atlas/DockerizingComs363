## An Alternative To Mysql Workbench

Mysql Workbench is the software installed by default on the VMs that we use in the class. If you are having issues accessing the VMs, then it’s recommended that you download it locally.

### Why An Alternative? <br>

I personally found that Mysql Workbench is clunky and lacks a lot of the features I enjoy in an IDE. A few of the the features I was looking for were: dark mode, VIM commands, and intellisense. I personally decided not to use it, because I did not want to install a software that I did not enjoy using. I also wanted to get started using a solution that I would most likely carry on with me moving forward. Instead I chose to use DataGrip, the IDE for databases provided by JetBrains.

DataGrip provides an environment which can be used with multiple different database
languages. There are also a lot of different plugins that can be used to tailor
the experience to your needs.

### Who Are They And How do I Get It?

JetBrains creates IDEs for a wide variety of programming languages, many of which have free Community Editions. Sadly they do not have a Community Edition of DataGrip. However, as a student you’re eligible for an educational license, allowing you to use all of their products for free. To get the educational license, press the ‘Apply Now’ button on the page. You sign up with your school email and are approved in minutes. Then you are able to download all of their programs and all you have to do is login when using them.

Once you have registered and gotten your educational license, you can download
the software.

## What Now?

You can now use it to connect to your local Docker Mysql container. The
instructions to do are outlined in the Mysql page on this site. 

If using the VPN or on campus you can also connect to the provided Mysql server.
The instructions provided with the course directly apply in this case. They are
also very similar to the ones in the Mysql link, except the address is
different.

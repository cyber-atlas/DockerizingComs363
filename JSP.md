## JSP Setup <br> 

Initially, I ran into a lot of issues with setting up a Tomcat container to deploy the JSP application. 

### Using IntelliJ IDEA <br>

Eventually, I ended up following the JetBrains guide for deploying a Java web application inside of a Tomcat server container.
I think the guide is well laid out and it even gives you an example to follow and build off of.
This method requires Docker Integration to be configured in IntelliJ.

## Getting Setup

### What Is Docker <br> 

Docker is a way to run and deploy containers running software on a virtualized
operating system. Docker containers are more lightweight and use less resources
than traditional Virtual Machines. They can be run on any operating system. <br>

Here is a much better description than what I provided. <br>

### Docker Setup <br>

#### Windows <br>

Windows has issues that other *nix* operating systems have. In this case there are
issues with virtualization. Hyper-V must be enable in order to work, but this
causes a loss of functionality with virtual machines managed by Virtualbox and
VMware. If this affects you, you can use Docker toolbox to circumvent this.
Otherwise, Docker Desktop is the best way to go. <br>

#### Mac <br> 

With OSx there are not the same virtualization issues that are in Windows, so you can install Docker Desktop
as normal. <br>

#### Linux <br> 

Linux also does not face the same virtalization issues as Windows, but Docker
Desktop is not available for it. You will just need to use the regular Docker
Server. Scroll about 3/4 through and chose your distro. It will then give you
step by step instructions.

### But I Want A GUI! <br> 

There are many GUI options available for Docker. I will not go in depth on them,
but will list them here:
